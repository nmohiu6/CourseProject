# CourseProject

This project contains the final project for CS 410. Here are a few files you should look at first in order to understand our code: 

CS 410 Documentation.pdf

CS410 Presentation.pdf

These two files will allow you to understand our code. I have linked our presentation video in CS410 Presentation.pdf, but here is another link:

Please read the 2 pdfs above and watch the video in order to understand how to run and use our code.
